Program Objective: Create a program to manage and analyze tourism statistics for cities
around the world. The program will use a menu-driven interface and a defined data structure
(city_info) to perform various tasks related to the data.
Main Menu Options:
1. View File Content:
○ Display the content of the data file in groups of 5 cities at a time.
○ Return the total number of cities in the file.
2. Load File Data to an Array:
○ Load data from the file into an array for further processing.
○ Close the data file after loading.
3. Get Ranking of a City X:
○ Get the ranking of a specified city.
○ City may or may not exist in the data.
4. Get Information about a City X:
○ Retrieve all information about a specified city.
○ Print details, including rank, location, yearly tourists, and most visited place.
○ City may or may not exist in the data.
5. Update the Number of Yearly Tourists of a City X:
○ Update the number of yearly tourists for a specified city.
○ Ensure the array remains sorted by the number of tourists.
○ City may or may not exist in the data.
6. Find the Most Visited Cities in a Country X:
○ Generate a file containing the names of cities and their most visited places for
a specified country.
○ Create the file only if the country exists in the data.
7. Remove a City from the Ranking:

General Guidelines and Notes:

Use a defined data structure called city_info to represent city information.
Avoid the use of global variables.
Handle error conditions and user input validation.
Close files properly and use the right access modes.
Options 3 to 7 should not be executed if option 2 was not chosen.
Implement functions for each menu option and a MENU function to display the menu
choices.
Use appropriate data types and structures to manage and analyze the data.
Ensure proper error handling and memory management.
No input/output functions should be used in user-defined functions for options 3 to 7.
